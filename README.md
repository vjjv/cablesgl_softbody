# cablesgl_softbody
Softbody logic for Cables.gl using Cannon.js

Pass all the mesh vertices to cannon js to create rigid bodies with all of them.
Then add elastic constraint to keep them together.



Please use them like the cables examples below :

- Softbody clothes : 'SoftbodyCloth2' op : https://cables.gl/p/8N6E-G

- Softbody mesh : 'SoftbodyTab_usingArrays' op : https://cables.gl/p/CRyNqC

- Softbody mesh : 'SoftbodyMesh_usingMaps' op : https://cables.gl/p/CRyNqC

SoftbodyTab is a V2 of the SoftbodyMesh and store values in js arrays instead of js Maps, results faster.

Enjoy
